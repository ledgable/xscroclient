## What is DLT?

Distributed Ledger Technology could be viewed as the foundation service platform of Blockchain. 
The P2P (peer to peer) protocol is not REALLY decentralised - It appears that way. Effectively you need a "tracker" (which we call an indexer), that assists you in finding content.
Datanodes contact the indexer to receive information updates and configuration changes. 

## Datanodes?

A datanode is a storage and communication engine that manages a number of chains. YES you heard that right - Ledgable's datanode infrastructure can handle MULTIPLE chains simultaneously.
Additionally, ontop of this engine sits an API webserver that enables custom applications to be built such that you can retreive and push data into the chains.

## Thanks

Of course thanks for the community and everyone thats helped in reaching this point. Looking forward to the next steps,

Samuel
